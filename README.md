Python for Data Science - 42 School Mini-Piscine

This repository contains my solutions and notes for the Python for Data Science mini-Piscine at 42 School.

ðŸ“Œ About the Mini-Piscine

The Python for Data Science mini-Piscine is an intensive, week-long program designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of Python programming and its applications in data science. The projects focus on essential Python concepts, including:

Basic Syntax & Data Structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets)

File Handling & I/O Operations

NumPy for Numerical Computations

Pandas for Data Manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn for Data Visualization

Basic Algorithms & Data Processing

ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

Day_00/ - Introduction to Python & basic exercises

Day_01/ - File handling, loops, and functions

Day_02/ - NumPy & working with arrays

Day_03/ - Pandas & data manipulation

Day_04/ - Data visualization & final project

ðŸš€ Goals

The goal of this mini-Piscine is to build a solid foundation in Python and understand how it can be used for data analysis, processing, and visualizationâ€”key skills for anyone entering the field of data science.
